          <p>I'm happily married to Deisy Gomez! We do not want kids :p</p>
          <p>I started my University degree at the National University of Colombia in Bogota, the capital of Colombia. While I was studying software engineering, I got the opportunity to start a double diploma in Paris, France with Télécom ParisTech.</p> 
          <p>I graduated from both programs in 2017.</p>
          <p>I got accepted to do an industrial Ph.D. thesis at Orange Labs Network at Lannion, France in late 2017.</p>
          <p>I started the thesis in 2018 and I've successfully defended on September 2021.</p>
