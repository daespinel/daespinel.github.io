            <p>Today's emerging needs (Internet of Things applications, Network Function Virtualization services, Mobile Edge computing, etc.) are challenging the classic approach of deploying a few large data centers to provide cloud services. A massively distributed Cloud-Edge architecture could better fit these new trends' requirements and constraints by deploying on-demand infrastructure services in Point-of-Presences within backbone networks. In this context, a key feature is establishing connectivity among several resource managers in charge of operating, each one a subset of the infrastructure. 
                
                After explaining the networking management challenges related to distributed Cloud-Edge infrastructures, this article surveys and analyzes the characteristics and limitations of existing technologies in the Software Defined Network field that could be used to provide the inter-site connectivity feature. We also introduce Kubernetes, the new de facto container orchestrator platform, and analyze its use in the proposed context.
                
                This survey is concluded by providing a discussion about some research directions in the field of SDN applied to distributed Cloud-Edge infrastructures' management.</p>

            <p>The deployment of a geo-distributed cloud infrastructure, leveraging for instance Point-of-Presences at the edge of the network, could better fit the requirements of Network Function Virtualization services and  Internet of Things applications. The envisioned architecture to operate such a widely distributed infrastructure relies on executing one instance of a Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) per location and implement appropriate code to enable collaborations between them when needed.  
                However, delivering the mechanisms that allow the collaborations is complex and error prone task.
                This is particularly true for the one in charge of establishing connectivity among VIM instances on-demand. Besides the reconfiguration of the network equipment, the main challenge is to design a mechanism that can offer usual network virtualization operations to the users while dealing with scalability and intermittent network properties of geo-distributed infrastructures. 
                
                In this paper, we present how such a challenge can be tackled in the context of OpenStack. More precisely, we introduce DIMINET, a DIstributed Module for Inter-site NETworking services capable to interconnect independent networking resources in an automatized and transparent manner. 
                DIMINET relies on a decentralized architecture where each agent communicates with others only if needed. Moreover, there is no global view of all networking resources but each agent is in charge of interconnecting resources that have been created locally. This approach enables us to mitigate management traffic and keep each site operational in case of network partitions. A promising approach to make other cloud-services collaborative on-demand.

            <p>The classic approach of deploying large data centers to provide Cloud services is being challenged by the emerging needs of Internet of Things applications, Network Function Virtualization services or Mobile edge computing. A massively distributed Cloud-Edge architecture could better fit the requirements and constraints of these new trends by deploying on-demand Infrastructure as a Service in different locations of the Internet backbone (i.e, network point of presences). A key requirement in this context is the establishment of connectivity among several virtual infrastructure managers in charge of operating each site. In this paper, we analyze the requirements and challenges raised by the inter-site connectivity management in a Cloud-Edge infrastructure. We also aim at initiating the discussion about the research directions on this field providing some interesting points to promote future work.

            <p>Software-Defined Networking logically centralizes the intelligence inside the SDN controller, therefore the fault tolerance of an SDN not only depends on the SDN controller availability but also on its timely forwarding decisions in realtime to circumvent faults on the data plane. In this paper we compare the behavior of the opensource SDN controllers OpenDaylight and ONOS when circumventing faults on the data plane and dealing with topological changes to ensure the continuity of service. We evaluated both controllers under a set of fault scenarios conceived to deploy fully customizable network topologies by keeping a better configuration control on the interconnections than the existing in current simulation tools such as Mininet.</p>
